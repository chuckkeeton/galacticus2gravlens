## galacticus2gravlens

This repository contains code to take semi-analytic models of galaxies from the [Galacticus code](https://bitbucket.org/galacticusdev/galacticus/wiki/Home) and produce input files for gravitational lensing calculations with the [gravlens package](http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~keeton/gravlens/2012WS).

Developed by Sean Brennan and Chuck Keeton, drawing on earlier code by Andrew Benson and Anthony Pullen.
